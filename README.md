# Vorticity-Vector-Potential-JAX

Navier-Stokes solver for 3D incompressible flows with the vorticity-vector potential formulation. For the discretization finnite differences have been used with 1st-oder Euler for the time derivative and 2nd-order Central Differences for spatial derivatives. The code uses a uniform collocated grid and is designed to run for the geometries of 3D lid driven cavity and duct geometry utilizing GPU capabilities.
